regex_pattern = r"(?<=\d)[,.](?=\d)"	# Do not delete 'r'. looking for is there any digit before and after ,.

// re is the regular expressions module in Python. It allows you to search, split, match, and manipulate strings using powerful pattern matching.
// The r before a string means "raw string" in Python. It tells Python not to treat backslashes \ as escape characters.
// \d → digit, \w → word character, \\ → literal backslash. without r we have to use an extra treat backslashes \.
// r is not a module or function — it's just a prefix in Python that creates a raw string.
// print("\n")   # This will create a new line, print(r"\n")  # This will literally print: \n
// just like f string (formatted string). 
// r & f both are string prefixes in Python that change how the string is interpreted.
