// re is the regular expressions module in Python. It allows you to search, split, match, and manipulate strings using powerful pattern matching.
// The r before a string means "raw string" in Python. It tells Python not to treat backslashes \ as escape characters.
// \d â†’ digit, \w â†’ word character, \\ â†’ literal backslash. without r we have to use an extra treat backslashes \.
